        <h2>Chinese imperial examinations were a civil service examination system in Imperial China for selecting candidates for the state bureaucracy.</h2>
        <p>The system reached its apogee during the Song dynasty and lasted until the final years of the Qing dynasty in 1905. The exams served to ensure a common knowledge of writing, the classics, and literary style among state officials.</p>

        <p class="content">Here is the timelime of the development of Imperial Examination:</p>
    </div>

    <div id="timeline" class="timeline">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AD 607</strong> - Emperor Yang of Sui established a new category of examinations for the "presented scholar".</li>
        <li><strong>AD 618 - 917</strong> - Under the Tang, six categories of regular civil-service examinations were organized by the Department of State Affairs and held by the Ministry of Rites: cultivated talents, classicists, presented scholars, legal experts, writing experts, and arithmetic experts.</li>
        <li><strong>AD 960 - 1279</strong> - In the Song dynasty (960 - 1279) the imperial examinations became the primary method of recruitment for official posts.</li>
        <li><strong>AD 937</strong> - By the decision of the Emperor Taizu of Song, the palace examination was supervised by the emperor himself.</li>
        <li><strong>AD 1037</strong> - From 1037 on, it was forbidden for examiners to supervise examinations in their home prefecture. Examiners and high officials were also forbidden from contacting each other prior to the exams.</li>
        <li><strong>AD 1105</strong> - The practice of recopying papers in order to prevent revealing the candidate's calligraphy was introduced at the capital and departmental level in 1105, and in the prefectures in 1037.</li>
        <li><strong>AD 1279</strong> - Imperial examinations were ceased for a time with the defeat of the Song in 1279 by Kublai Khan and his Yuan dynasty.</li>
        <li><strong>AD 1315</strong> - The examination system was revived in 1315, with significant changes, during the reign of Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan.</li>
        <li><strong>AD 1384</strong> - In addition to the Neo-Confucian canon, Hongwu added another portion to the exams to be taken by successful candidates five days after the first exam. These new exams emphasized shixue (practical learning), including subjects such as law, mathematics, calligraphy, horse riding, and archery.</li>
        <li><strong>AD 1385</strong> - The first palace examination of the Ming dynasty was held.</li>
        <li><strong>AD 1600</strong> - There were roughly 500,000 shengyuan in a population of 150 million, that is, one per 300 people. </li>
        <li><strong>AD 1723</strong> - Han Chinese graduates of the palace examination were required to learn the Manchu language.</li>
        <li><strong>AD 1864</strong> - Li Hongzhang submitted proposals to add a new subject into the Imperial examinations involving Western technology, that scholars may focus their efforts entirely on this.</li>
        <li><strong>AD 1888</strong> - the Imperial examinations was expanded to include the subject of international commerce.</li>
        <li><strong>AD 1905</strong> - the throne ordered the examination system be discontinued, beginning at the first level in 1905. The new system provided equivalents to the old degrees; a bachelor's degree, for instance, would be considered equivalent to the Xiucai.</li>
      </ul>
