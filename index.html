      <h2>Chinese imperial examinations were a civil service examination system in Imperial China for selecting candidates for the state bureaucracy.</h2>
      <p>The system reached its apogee during the Song dynasty and lasted until the final years of the Qing dynasty in 1905. The exams served to ensure a common knowledge of writing, the classics, and literary style among state officials.</p>
